# Louvre Frontend

This is a mini online version of the Louvre museum in which guests
 can login and view ancient art pieces and know about their 
 history and artists. Also, museum staff can manage art pieces 
 and view system guests. We will do this by building a 
 simple backend microservice in NodeJS, 
 and a frontend service based on ReactJS to consume this API. 
 
 The project will have these functionalities:

● JWT Authentication

● RBAC (role based authentication)

● Performing CRUD on the api

## Useful Links

Deployment on Heroku: https://louvre.omarafifi.com/

Backend Github: https://github.com/omarafifii/louvre-backend

## Usage

Use these users for testing the application:-

**For Admin user**

username: admin

password: admin

**For normal user**

username: omar

password: password

## Things present in the application

* JWT Authentication
* Persistant session after refresh
* Pagination
* React Routing
* React Hooks and Context API

##
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
